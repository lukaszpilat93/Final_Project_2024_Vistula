  <p>This manual is aimed at fresh graduates of philological studies and/or applied linguistics, wishing to find out more about what is expected from them while working on German to Polish projects for Mercedes-Benz AG/Daimler Truck AG. It is meant to provide them with a brief overview of the workflow requirements, depending on the ordered process.
