During your recruitment process you were given a brief introduction to the company's main main fields of expertise. 
Since your scope of responsibilities will include translating automotive manuals from German to Polish,
you must know the core differences between the two types you are likely to encounter after the onboarding process:

| File type          | Way of addressing the reader | General tone of voice | Abbreviation rules |
|--------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Manual             | Ty/informal                  | Direct, informal      | Follow standard    |
| Newsletter         | Friendly                     | Conversational         | Use sparingly      |
| Academic paper     | Formal                       | Objective              | Define on first use|
| Technical document | Direct                       | Clear and precise      | Use consistently   |
| Blog post          | Casual                       | Informal               | Avoid excessively  |
