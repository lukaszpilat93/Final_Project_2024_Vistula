FILE TYPES - WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT
===============

During your recruitment process, you were given a brief introduction to the company's main fields of expertise. 
Since your scope of responsibilities will include translating automotive manuals from German to Polish,
you must know the core differences between the two types you are likely to encounter after the onboarding process:

| Document type | Way of addressing the reader             | Tone of voice | Abbreviations                                    |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Nars          | Informal, simple and friendly (2nd person singular) | Informal      | Field-specific abbreviations allowed, first instance explained |
| ARKI          | Formal, official (3rd person plural)   | Formal        | Abbreviations allowed, first instance explained, only use widely known abbreviations |


**SPECIFIC HINTS FOR NARS FILES**

Please also note that in the Nars files you will find some specific codes that indicate a special workflow.

Whenever you see an *AP00 file*, please do not follow the normal structure for orders, as e.g. Dokręć śrubę, but use the infinitive form, instead. This is especially important as these files are integral parts
of the so-called service sheets, i.e. lists of actions, instead of simple instructions. In order to proceed in a proper manner, always consult the source files you can find in the project reference material folder. 

**SPECIFIC HINTS FOR ARKI FILES**

ARKI files may contain some contens specific for the target market. Whenever you encounter some of these, please always refer to the reference material provided or, in case this does not solve the issue, consult your
Mercedes-Benz AG or Daimler Truck AG contact person. Ensure that you do it BEFORE the project submission deadline so as to avoid any potential issues pertaining to files correction or, even worse, escalation. These files
have a very tight time to market schedule!
